# Process Notes - Single-page design portfolio solution

A useful practice I've found is to be deliberate and methodical when it comes to a new project, especially during initial set up. Starting with this project I will be documenting my process as I go through it, making notes, identifying areas where I need to learn & experiment, and anything else I might encounter.

## Overview

### Initial Setup

The very first thing I do is download all the files I need, create files that I don't have, and set up the directory structure. Here's my typical setup for a very simple one-page project (a local file server is only used out of convenience, not necessity):

```css
.
â””â”€â”€ parent directory/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ NOTES.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
    â””â”€â”€ resources/
        â”œâ”€â”€ css/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reset.css
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.css
        â”œâ”€â”€ images/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.png
        â””â”€â”€ js/
            â””â”€â”€ index.js

```

The Frontend Mentor projects provide a basic index.html page to start, but if I was starting from scratch, that would be a step included here. I use VSCode and it's just a few keystrokes to get a file in the directory.

*This one is important!* I test all the links between files making sure that:
- app.js is serving the file locally (if I'm using a file server)
- index.css is linked by changing the background color
- index.js is linked by popping up an alert

This can prevent a headache down the road when something doesn't appear to be working but it's just a file not linked correctly.

### Design System

This could also be where I go through the design files, make notes, plan for how I want to accomplish something...but I find that the work of setting up the design system is quite satisfying before I begin thinking about (potentially) harder problems.

The design system will include the following:
- document font size, weight, family
- colors, including creating any custom variables
- headers
- buttons

It could also include:
- anchors
- hover states
- visibility or display states

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
