## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I took a lot of notes while I did this project. Check them out here: 
Project Notes: [Project Notes](./NOTES.md)

### Continued development

The practice of review, plan, note-taking worked really well. Still some details I missed and had to make little hot-fixes for because I didn't really feel like revamping a whole bunch of styling for my one error. But since that is the correct thing to do, and is also a big time waste, next time I hope to catch those details prior to getting myself stuck into a situation.

### Useful resources

- ChatGPT: really made a big difference in pointing me in the right direction, even if the code examples weren't quite right
- [Conor Bailey: Vanilla JavaScript Infinite Scrolling Image Slider](https://youtu.be/4UXJb4rjeDg) - Not exactly what I wanted but I need to enable scrolling with the keyboard or scroll wheel so I will be revisiting prior to submitting the solution
